##### The Beginning

I remember the first time I used a computer, it was my parents' old Windows XP machine. I was fascinated by how it worked. My very first interaction with it was playing an offline game called "Pinball" and I was instantly hooked.

Soon after, I discovered web browsers and the internet, and I found myself spending hours playing Flash games. Club Penguin, Blablaland, Fancy Pants, Electricman... I can't even count the number of hours I poured into those games.

Back then, computers were just a source of entertainment for me. I was always looking for new games to play or new shows to watch (I also started watching anime, I think my first ones were *Naruto* and *Sword Art Online*). One day, my dad gave me my older sister's old laptop. It was a Windows 7 machine with barely 4GB of RAM, but it was enough for what I needed at the time. That's when I started getting curious about what else I could do with a computer.

##### Using Computers for More Than Just Games

I discovered the world of computer science when I wanted to create my own Minecraft server. I didn't have the money to host it online, so I downloaded the .jar file and figured out how to launch it on my laptop, running both the server and the game on the same machine. I couldn't forward my ports because I didn't have access to the Wi-Fi admin panel, so I used Hamachi to connect with friends. I learned so much from that experience, honestly, it was one of the best times of my life.

Later on, I tried creating my own mods, but I didn't know how to code yet. Around the same time, I started getting more interested in how computers work, their components, and the science behind them. I've always been curious about how things function. I used to take apart my toys just to see what was inside and try to put them back together. I even secretly disassembled and reassembled my parents' computer, played around with BIOS settings, and installed Ubuntu on my laptop. That was back in 2014, I was only 12!

##### Going Professional


I earned my first diploma in engineering sciences, a natural choice given my love for technology and problem-solving. After that, I went on to university to study computer science and software engineering. I learned about programming, algorithms, data structures and networking, and I found it all incredibly fascinating.

At the end of my second year, I landed an internship at a software development company where I worked on a web application using PHP and Symfony. Web development seemed like the perfect fit, high impact, relatively easy to get started with, and well-paid, so I decided to specialize in it.

During the last three years of my studies, I focused on web development. I applied what I learned in class directly to my internships. I built complex web applications using modern technologies like React, TypeScript, and Golang.

In France, there's a system called "alternance" which allows students to work and study at the same time. My schedule was two weeks at work and one week at school. Thanks to this, I gained valuable real-world experience and earned a master's degree in the process.

Today, I work as a Fullstack Web Developer at Fives CortX in France, where I contribute to building innovative software solutions for Industry 4.0.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and sharpening my skills. I'm always eager to discover emerging trends and deepen my understanding of the tech world.
